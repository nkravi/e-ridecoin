# eth-ridecoin
A rideshare coin on ethereum blockchain 


Ride-share services such as Uber, Lyft requires all drivers and riders to transact through middleman.
Riders and Drivers pay up to 30% commision to the middleman.

In eth-ridecoin we eliminate the middleman and offer the same service using decentralized crypto-currency.
We use the existing eherum blockchanin and create DAPPS with smartcontracts. Drivers pays riders in Ether.
